   <p>Welcome to a website that celebrates people who have Autism! It’s not always easy to have autism, but it’s harder when people try to change a person with autism instead of embracing them for who they are or only show pity for them.  Each individual brings their own beauty and uniqueness to the world. We need to work together with our friends with Autism to make a world that is better for everyone!
Click on the picture and find out what Autism is, watch a movie with fantastic children with Autism, find recipes and discover activities to do with a child with Autism. Let’s accept those with ASD. Let’s be better together!
